# BANK-NEST-SERVER

This project is a portfolio showcasing the implementation of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns within a Nest.js backend system. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of using EDA and CQRS in modern web applications.

## Overview

The portfolio project is structured around a core backend system built with Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. By leveraging the EDA and CQRS patterns, the project aims to separate the read and write operations, ensuring high performance and maintainability, while also efficiently handling real-time data updates through events.
